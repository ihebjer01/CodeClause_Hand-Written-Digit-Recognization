# CodeClause_Hand-Written-Digit-Recognization
The project can be divided into various steps : 
Import necessary libraries
,Load and split the MNIST dataset into training and testing sets.
,Normalize the pixel values of the dataset.
,Create a neural network model with a flattened input layer, two dense hidden layers, and a dense output layer.
,Compile and optimize the model with the adam optimizer and sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss function.
,Train the model using the training data.And
evaluate the model using the testing data.
